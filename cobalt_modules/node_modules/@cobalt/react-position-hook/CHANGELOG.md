* Now usePosition resets position when target element is hidden ([95d8bd7](https://github.com/Talkdesk/cobalt/commit/95d8bd76c044b7b000fd9f047d85f90ad4704ddc))


### Features

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/Talkdesk/cobalt/compare/@cobalt/react-position-hook@1.1.0...@cobalt/react-position-hook@2.0.0) (2021-04-16)


### Features

* Add optimal positioning algorithm ([f33a76a](https://github.com/Talkdesk/cobalt/commit/f33a76ab3f31f826d128cb0b2996f17511e2bdeb))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* usePosition now returns an object with two keys: `position` and `elementRef`
The first follows the same rules as before. The second is a ref to be passed to the element
tat is expected to be optimal positioned (eg: Popup).
If you don't need optimal positioning, you can simply deconstruct the `position` and use it as in previous versions.
